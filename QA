1. What is your daily 𝘁𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀
   (operations)
   first activty in the morning,
   i have to check and report health status of active prod cluster which includes
   cassandra db cluster(3 instances) health status,
   production active cluster LBs, ingress screenshots
   prometeus and grafana (active cluster services cpu usage)
   need to check 4xx,5xx errors in splunk/opensearch screenshots
   if any service deployment is requested thourgh ticket, have to deploy in production.
   certificate expiry if any, renewal
   switch traffic from previous active cluster to current active cluster if production active cluster is changed
2. Is it 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 to have 𝗽𝗵𝘆𝘀𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿. What kind of 𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿 that you really like 𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗿𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 must have
   my project infra is built in aws cloud using terraform. we use on-premise datacenters for maintaining  cassandra/ postgres db.
3. How are we going to install our 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻. What are the 𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 that you are 𝗮𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁.
   our project designed and implmented based on microservice architecture.we have created CI/CD pipeline to compile, build,execute unit testcases, generate code quality repot using sonarqube, create docker image, deploy. as soon as PR gets approved. this build process gets triggered.
   after docker image generated, scrum teams use gitops to deploy service in cluster.
4. Are you aware about 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 and 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀.
	docker is used for containerizing our application (example backend service) with the help of dockerfile.
	k8s is meant for orchestration purpose like autoscaling, health check. we use deployment files to configure the image and resources allocated to run the image as container like cpu,memory.
5. Why do we need 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿
   in the era microservice architecture, unlike monolithic, entire project is divided into multiple small services. to run this services, we dont need heavy infrastructure and  with docker, we dont need bother about os, installing application runtime install on the server.
   when we build docker image, we ensure that everything is required to run the application is included as part of it using dockerfile.
   so, docker container runs/responds/behaves similar way irrespective of environment where you run lower environment/testing/ production.
6. What is 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗿?
   container is mini server conatins all the softwares/runtimes(os,java,python,nodejs) required to run our application
7. The thing I talked about 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻. That could be 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗱 as a 𝗺𝗶𝗰𝗿𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲. Can I directly put it in the 𝗱𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗿?
   first built docker image by specifying os and applcation runtime and compiled files and configuration files to be copied in specific structure.
   then using k8s, we run the image as container.
8. Uses of 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀 over 𝗱𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗿?
   k8s is an orchestration tool. it has features that helps to autoscale our services based on load, rolling update new version of the service.
   on peak black friday, based on the load ( mostly cpu), instances should be created automatically. we can acheive this out of box using k8s horizontal scaling.
9. One of the 𝗽𝗼𝗱 is down. Which runs the 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗿 and my 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 is entirely 𝗱𝗼𝘄𝗻 which connects to my 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲 and 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲 is also 𝗱𝗼𝘄𝗻. So basically, the entire 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 is 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲. So, what are the 𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗽𝘀 that you would take care to 𝗯𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘂𝗽 the 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 along with the 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲.
	1. i will check server logs to identify the reason for application down. it shows db connectivity error if db is down.
	2. normally we have db cluster. if db instance is down, i will try to make it up. if it doesnt, i will ask the team to change the configuration to connect to other instance of the cluster.
	3. mean while will create RCA and assign to db team
10. Do you know 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 using the AWS 𝗖𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱𝗪𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵?
11. I have some 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝘀 on 𝗖𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱𝗪𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵 and I have 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 some of the 𝗮𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘁𝘀. For me to get the 𝗻𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻. How do I do the 𝘀𝗲𝘁𝘂𝗽 ?
12. What if I 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝘄𝗮𝗻𝘁 to get an 𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗹 and I wanted the alert to be routed to a 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗹.
    with the helps of lambda and event bridge rules, we can acheive this.
	but rules must configured in advance and lambda must be created to send request slack/teams channel
	go to slack/team's api, get the request payload format and you know the channel url where to send the request.
	
13. How can we 𝘁𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗰𝗮𝗿𝗲 of 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆.
    with help of creating vpc, subnets, sgs, we can control which resource can access what resource
14. Do understand 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 about 𝗹𝗮𝗺𝗯𝗱𝗮
    lambda is server less aws service to run your code without any instances(mostly java, python can be used to write the lambda)
	for python, it expects lamda_handler method in your code. lambda calls your method.
15. Have you worked on 𝗧𝗲𝗿𝗿𝗮𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺 or 𝗖𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱𝗙𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻.
    yes,terraform is used for provisioning/managing eks cluster. it is helpful to create consistent infra across mutlple environments. and cloudformation is used to create/deploy lambda functions to trigger any job (ex: as soon as the file created in s3 bucket, it should trigger a job in jenkins automcatially)  cloudformation is more specific to managing aws resources
16. How would you do 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀 to the 𝗧𝗲𝗿𝗿𝗮𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺
    create a branch ==> make changes and create tfplan (terraform plan -out=<file-name>). for human readability we use tfplan.json
	create PR --> after approved the PR --> merge changes --> run the job
17. Do you know 𝗵𝗼𝘄 to 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲 a 𝗣𝗥
18. Have you worked on 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 of a 𝗽𝗶𝗽𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲
19. How is your 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁
20. Explain me the 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲 𝗰𝘆𝗰𝗹𝗲 of 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁
21. What is 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁
	we trigger lambda to send payload to bmc remedy with few manadatory params. url is specific to organization. check in google for more paramters
	but below first 4 are manadatory for creating incident for BMC remedy tool
	{
    "values": {
        "Status": "Assigned",
        "Impact": "2-High",
        "Urgency": "2-High",
        "Product Name": "Email Service",
        "Notes": "Reported an inability to access email services."
    }
}
22. What is 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆
23. Do you know what is 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺 𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗸𝗲𝘁?
24. Have you been part of any 𝗥𝗖𝗔 and 𝗳𝗶𝘅𝗶𝗻𝗴 it with respect to 𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗿𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲.
25. What are the 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 that you have 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 for 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴?
prometeous for collecting metrics from the node and graphana is monitoring
26. What are the 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝘀 that you have 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 in 𝗚𝗿𝗮𝗳𝗮𝗻𝗮. (edited)
